OBJECTIVE:-

The goal of this program is to create a simple calculator that can perform basic arithmetic operations like addition, subtraction, multiplication, and division. It ensures ease of use and handles errors like invalid inputs or division by zero.

__________________________________________________________________________________________________________________________________________________________________________________________
KEY ACTIVITIES:-

1. User Interaction:

Prompts the user to input two numbers (either integers or floats).
Asks the user to choose an operation (Addition, Subtraction, Multiplication, Division) by selecting from a numbered menu.


2. Operations:

Addition (+)

Subtraction (-)

Multiplication (*)

Division (/) with a safeguard against division by zero.


3.Result Formatting:

Uses the format_result function to format the result as an integer if the output is a whole number, otherwise retains it as a float.


4. Error Handling:

Catches invalid numerical inputs using a try-except block to ensure the program doesn't crash with unexpected input.

5.User Feedback:

Displays error messages for invalid operations or when attempting division by zero.


6.Showing Results
Displays the result of the calculation.
